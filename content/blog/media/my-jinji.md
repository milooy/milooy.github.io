푹 빠져서 황홀하게 눈 감고 약하게 드럼 치기

Jinji는 baby라고 해석하면 된대.

뒤에 4분간의 Jamming은 동일한 멜로디의 반복이지만 귀를 뗄 수 없고
다 들으면 또 듣고싶어져

Every time you lie in my place
I do want to say
It's you, you my babe
I won't be too late

Jinji don't you cry
this world out of time
of time out of mind
Jinji please don't cry
In this world out of time
Time out of mind
(out of mind)

Every time you lie in my place
I do want to say
It's you, you my babe
I'm down to the drain

Jinji don't you cry
This world out of time
Old time out of mind
Jinji please don't lie
In this world out of time
Time out of mind
(out of mind)

Every time you lie in my place
I do want to say
It's you, you my babe
It won't be too late

Oh don't leave me behind
without you, I'll cry
Cause only you my baby
Only you can conquer time
Only you can conquer time
Oh sometimes I
Without you, i would cry
Cause only you my baby
Only you can conquer time
Oh don't leave me behind
without you, I will cry
Cause only you my baby
Only you can conquer time
Only you can conquer time
Oh sometimes I
Without you, I will cry
Only you can conquer time
Only you can conquer time
